# Ringtone Audio File
# 
# For a production deployment, replace this placeholder with an actual MP3 ringtone file.
# You can:
# 1. Use a free ringtone from https://freesound.org/ or https://zapsplat.com/
# 2. Generate one using online tools like https://www.beepbox.co/
# 3. Record your own ringtone
#
# Place the MP3 file at: client/public/ringtone.mp3
#
# For now, the IncomingCallModal will work without audio (browser will show a warning in console)
